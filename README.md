#Dice_Game 

Dice_Game is a React-based dice game application that utilizes React concepts such as props, the useState hook, and styled-components for styling.

## Project Structure & Features

-React with Vite: The application is set up using Vite, providing a minimal and efficient development environment for React applications.â€‹

-State Management with useState: The game leverages React's useState hook to manage the state of the dice, ensuring that the UI updates dynamically as the game progresses.â€‹

-Component-Based Architecture: The application is modular, with components likely representing individual dice and the game logic, promoting reusability and maintainability.â€‹

-Styled-Components for Styling: The use of styled-components allows for writing CSS-in-JS, enabling scoped and dynamic styling of components based on their state.â€‹

## ðŸ§  Advanced React Concepts

-Props for Component Communication: Props are used to pass data and functions between components, facilitating communication and data flow within the application.â€‹

-Dynamic Styling: Styled-components enable dynamic styling of components based on their props or state, allowing for responsive and interactive UI elements.â€‹

-Efficient State Updates: By using useState, the application ensures that state updates are handled efficiently, triggering re-renders only when necessary.
